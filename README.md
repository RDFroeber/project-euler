Project Euler
=============
[Project Euler]("http://projecteuler.net") is a website dedicated to a series of computational problems intended to be solved with computer programs.

Here you will find my solutions to various Project Euler problems using JavaScript. [Require.js]("http://requirejs.org/") is used to load libraries such as jQuery and Underscore and the problem solutions themselves.
